Well let us be honest these sets of Higurashi arcs are not the optimal place for a new person to jump into the franchise. Best place to start would be either to read the Higurashi visual novel or manga of the original Higurashi arcs. The 2006 anime by Studio Deen is passable for introducing Higurashi. Newcomers can still enjoy Gou and Sotsu as the main topic and conflict is mostly standalone from the original story. The major issue would be a lot of the characters and world are left underdeveloped as it was previously done in the original story.  There are also spoilers for the ending of the original story.

Before Gou first aired, I was reading the Higurashi visual novel for the first time as the first arc was free on steam due to the pandemic. It was pleasant to revisit the series since it had been a long time Higurashi Kai and Rei aired. I found out a new Higurashi anime was releasing later in the year and was excited to see updated visuals. Higurashi Gou first aired and quickly became apparent it was not a remake by episode 2. I finished the original visual novel when the Gou's Onidanmashi arc finished. 

Now armed with refresh knowledge of the original, I am able to recognize Gou presented lots of interesting changes. This increase my engagement with solving Higurashi's new mystery. I had an easier time seeing the differences and what really matters as I know the rules for the curse. I would imagine a new viewer would be bogged down with comprehending the basic rules.

Gou was a lot of fun especially up until the final confirmation for the main culprit. The rest of Gou competently setups the motive and cause of the events. A new character shows up and starts saying things that implicate the larger meta world.

I read Umineko as witch hunt was releasing the translations for the comiket versions so needed a refresher for that series as well. During the break for Sotsu, I went and reread Umineko and finally started Ciconia.

Personally at the end of Gou, I felt like there was not a lot left as the last two Gou arcs essentially were enough as answer arcs. The When They Cry series has always been divided up into two as the question and answer/core arcs. The question arcs is simply the mystery. The answer arcs presents a new story that provides larger hints or unveils events that recontextualize earlier arcs. Meakashi is the only original arc that told nearly the same story but with a different perspective. Even then Meakashi provided a decent chunk of backstory and world building.

Now Sotsu issues stems from having to retrace very similar events. There are some tweaks and new scenes that keep things mildly interesting but there was no major build up to anything new for a large portion of Sotsu. The only major driving force was seeing how the big confrontation setup in Gou would play out. I had a similar issue parts of Meakashi as it is mainly rewatching events without any new information. It was probably more painful in Sotsu because the the episode was released weekly.

I have almost 100% convince myself Sotsu elongated setup solely to get episode 34 to fit in somehow. The final stretch of Sotsu was enjoyable and ended on a very higurashi themed ending.

  <summary>Click to show spoilers. Themes</summary>

A theme in the original story is the lack in bonds and communication would lead to sin. Mental illnesses is also major motif. Gou and Sotsu is one way to logical follow up on these ideas. It is the excessive clinging to bonds that results in this round of tragedy. 

The root of the problem was shown during Satokowashi where Rika's dream and Satoko's dream are in conflict. A scenario that can occur during graduation where friends have to choose to split up or follow one another. We are shown why Satoko does not like her lifestyle following Rika. Satoko faces deteriorating mental health and with signs of abandonment. Audience can sympathize with Satoko plight. Obviously the answer is not murder. It just creates a loop of tragedy. 

It is only when Rika finally confronts Satoko pushes the issue for an answer. Sotsu Episode 14 was a nice visual treat but it was mainly a flashy way of saying Rika and Satoko needed to confront each other. In the end both, parties have dreams in direct conflict. They express why the other is not able to fulfill each other's dream and the solution is to go their separate ways to purse the next best option. Moving on to their own lives does not mean forsaking the other for all eternity. There will always be chances in the future to reconnect. 

Lesson is that both parties need to communicate and agree that their dreams may not workout but they still can hold onto their bonds.  Sotsu ends with a new version of You to fit into the themes.

Higurashi Gou and Sotsu is more of a fun side story that cleans up some character arcs from the original story. This entry does slightly add flavor to the extended metaverse but the metaverse is usually just fanservice for the loyal followings. Well hopefully we can look forward to a new Umineko project or Cicona Phase II.
