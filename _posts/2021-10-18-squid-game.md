Squid Game is fairly large topic right now even though I just learned about it a few days ago. I recently finished binging the entire series and have some thoughts particularly about one episode. This will be going into full spoilers so fair warning. I will set up my initial experience and go into a depth about a particular episode. 

This is my rare dive into live action side of entertainment. I primarily stick to Japanese anime because I find it aesthetically pleasing. My interests were also more drawn towards Japanese, Chinese, and Korean culture and history. I am fairly experience in mostly Japanese otaku culture and Korean MMORPG. Recently, I started dabbling in Korean and Chinese web novels. Overall, I have a great lack of Korean specific cultural knowledge but enough Asian media that I was not going to be caught completely blindsided by the premises of Squid Game. Last chance before I dive into the premise and then spoilers of Squid Game.

I essentially did no research and dived straight into episode one. Squid Game at its core is essentially a battle royale death game. Now, I have seen many variations of the the battle royale genre such as Btooom, Liar Game, Mirai Nikki, Gamble Fish and Magical Girl Rising Project to name a few. It is a commonly used plot in manga around late 2000 to early 2010. Even now there are plenty of new iterations around the whole concept of high stakes or death game. Typically, we get a group of people from all walks of life. A mix of environment, equipment, abilities, or rules to equalize the playing field. Usually ending in some big human experiment, betting spectacle, or some divine joke. The setting lends itself to examine humanity when pushed to extreme conditions. 

Squid Game follows the formula very well. Uses children games as they are simple rules and can appeal to the audience's sense of nostalgia. It gathers a varied casts of players that are knocked down and kept down by society for various reasons. We have our main cast Seong Gi-hun a man who wants to be there for the people he cares but spiraling into gambling addiction to find a reversal in life. Cho Sang-woo the village's prodigy who landed a successful career but seems to have dipped into white collar crimes to maintain the successful son facade. Kang Sae-byeok a northern defector (excuse me if this is not the appropriate term) who is trending the underworld to gather her family to start in another country. Oh Il-nam, an aged ill man that wants to enjoy his remaining time. Ali Abdul the discriminated immigrant working to support his family.
