Who is not talking about Squid Game right now. I learned about this show a few days ago from a recommendation during a twitch stream. I recently finished binging the entire series and have some thoughts particularly about one episode. This will be going into spoilers so fair warning. I will set up my initial experience and go in-depth about a particular episode. 

I essentially did no research and dived straight into episode one. Squid Game at its core is essentially a battle royale death game. Now, I have seen many variations of the the battle royale genre such as Btooom, Liar Game, Mirai Nikki, Gamble Fish and Magical Girl Rising Project to name a few. It is a commonly used plot in manga around late 2000 to early 2010. Even now there are plenty of new iterations around the whole concept of high stakes or death game. Typically, we get a group of people from all walks of life. A mix of environment, equipment, abilities, or rules to equalize the playing field. Usually ending in some human experiment, betting spectacle, or some divine joke. The setting lends itself to examine humanity when pushed to extreme conditions. 

Squid Game follows the formula very well. Children games are used as the great equalizer due to the simple rules and appeals to nostalgia. It gathers a varied casts of players that are knocked down and kept down by society. We have our main cast, Seong Gi-hun a man who wants to be there for the people he cares but spiralling into gambling addiction to find a reversal in life. Cho Sang-woo, the village's prodigy, who landed a successful career but seems to have dipped into white collar crimes to maintain the good son facade. Kang Sae-byeok, a northern defector, involve in the underworld to gather her family for a new start. Oh Il-nam, an aged man, that wants to enjoy his remaining time. Jang Deok-Su, the thug and bully, a gangster who crossed some bigger thugs. Ali Abdul, the immigrant, working to support his family.  

We observe players in a stressful environment resort to horrendous acts of betrayal and evils to selfishly get ahead. On the flip side, there is also the human compassion for others and bonding in the face of adversity. Episode six is the prefect encapsulation of these themes. Episode six is some games with marbles and had everyone pair up. Let us take a look at the pairings. 

First up, we have Deok-Su and his henchmen 278. Deok-Su believes the strongest is the most fit so he rules the group with violence and coercion. He gathered like minded followers who follow the strong but are looking to be the strongest themselves. It was mention in an earlier episode that Deok-Su has a likelihood of being usurp by his own group. We see it manifest here when henchmen 278 gets their chance to beat Deok-Su. We have a straightforward example of human capacity to be be ruthless cut throat. Just as the last marble of this game shows Deok-Su got out only by luck. The one on top is only hanging there by mere chances and coincidences. Betrayal is a standard it is only a matter of time and chances.

Next we move to Sang-woo and Ali. Ali is in a foreign country and working in dodgy manual labor. He is used to taking the lower position in a social dynamic. That is why Ali defaults to nim instead of ssi when talking to Sang-woo in episode two. Throughout the games Sang-woo and Gi-hun help supplement Ali's ignorance in language and culture. That is why Ali sees these two people as reliable teammates and begins forming friendly bonds. Ali changes the honorifics as the episodes go by to show how close he has grown as a friend.

Sang-woo is an interesting character but for brevity I will only touch upon his archetype here. He is the prime example of a modern day pragmatist. Sang-woo always weigh the cost and benefits while helping others when it is not detrimental to himself. This behaviour pattern can also be cynically interpreted as putting on a facade of human relationships for your own benefits. He creates the team but never sticks his neck out cautious of the smallest risk. 

Sang-woo's behavior is on the same side of the selfishness scale as Deok-Su but is able to foster long term useful connections. The logical end in this dynamic is Sang-woo coming out on top by taking advantage of Ali's trust.  Humans are capable of forming bonds and equally capable of taking advantage of those bonds.

Sae-byeok and Ji-Yeong is the other pair that closely resemble each other. They are on the opposite end of the scale of Deok-su. Both are females that has built walls to shield themselves from the world due to their past hardships. We get a bonding moment where the two connect and listen to each other life stories and motivations. There is enough clues to when Ji-Yeong decides the game who was going to advance from this pairing.  This pair demonstrates the human capacity to be self sacrificial for another's benefit.

Finally, we have Gi-hun and Il-nam pairing. We see Il-nam show signs of deteriorating mental faculties placing him in vulnerable position. The dynamic is very similar to Sang-woo and Ali.  Sang-woo is Gi-hun's foil. They both act similar but have differing core beliefs of the world.  Sang-woo acts for his own benefit and self-image. Gi-hun defaults to caring for other and takes action he views that will be beneficial to others. That does not automatically make Gi-hun a saint. He also has self preservation instinct. He is also looking for ways to survive this crisis with the only option of betraying his friend. Gi-hun is visibly remorseful at cheating Il-nam. We eventually end up seeing Il-nam confront Gi-hun on his betrayal yet still consider Gi-hun a friend. This gives way to the highest emotional point of the episode where Il-nam grants Gi-hun the winning condition based on the friendship they had together.

The games wrap up in that specific order in the episode. It starts at selfish betrayal end of the scale. It moves to the pragmatic middle. Then it goes to the selfless sacrifice. Finally the last is the lessons from the previous three. People have the capacity to betray and yet everyone can connect and forgive. The betrayer is jaded by the world and seeks to protect themselves. The one betrayed can connect, understand, and forgive. The forgiven betrayer can regain a part of their trust in humanity.
