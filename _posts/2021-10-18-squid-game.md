Squid Game who is not talking about Squid Game. Might as well throw my thoughts out there. I just learned about this show a few days ago by an offhand comment during a twitch stream. I recently finished binging the entire series and have some thoughts particularly about one episode. This will be going into full spoilers so fair warning. I will set up my initial experience and go in-depth about a particular episode. 

This is my rare dive into live action side of entertainment. I primarily stick to Japanese anime because I find it aesthetically pleasing. My interests were also more drawn towards Japanese, Chinese, and Korean culture and history. I am fairly experience in mostly Japanese otaku culture and Korean MMORPG. Overall, I have a great lack of Korean specific cultural knowledge but enough Asian media that I was not going to be completely blindsided by Squid Game. Last chance before I dive into the premise and then spoilers of Squid Game.

I essentially did no research and dived straight into episode one. Squid Game at its core is essentially a battle royale death game. Now, I have seen many variations of the the battle royale genre such as Btooom, Liar Game, Mirai Nikki, Gamble Fish and Magical Girl Rising Project to name a few. It is a commonly used plot in manga around late 2000 to early 2010. Even now there are plenty of new iterations around the whole concept of high stakes or death game. Typically, we get a group of people from all walks of life. A mix of environment, equipment, abilities, or rules to equalize the playing field. Usually ending in some big human experiment, betting spectacle, or some divine joke. The setting lends itself to examine humanity when pushed to the extreme conditions. 

Squid Game follows the formula very well. Squid Game uses children games as the great equalizer as the games have simple rules and appeals to nostalgia. It gathers a varied casts of players that are knocked down and kept down by society for various reasons. We have our main cast, Seong Gi-hun a man who wants to be there for the people he cares but spiraling into gambling addiction to find a reversal in life. Cho Sang-woo, the village's prodigy, who landed a successful career but seems to have dipped into white collar crimes to maintain the successful son facade. Kang Sae-byeok, a northern defector, involve in the underworld to gather her family to start in another country. Oh Il-nam, a discriminated aged ill man, that wants to enjoy his remaining time. Jang Deok-Su, the thug and bully, a gangster who crossed dangerous people. Ali Abdul, the discriminated immigrant, working to support his family.  

Alright, everything is setup to start discussing episode six. By episode six, the audience has a good understanding of the main cast and Deok-Su plus his henchmen dynamics. The marbles game had everyone pair up. Let us take a look at the pairings.

First up we have Deok-Su and his henchmen 278. Deok-Su believes the strongest is the most fit so he rules the group with violence and coercion. He gathered like minded followers who follow the strong but are looking to be the strongest themselves. It was mention in an earlier episode that Deok-Su has a likelihood of being usurp by his own group. We see it manifest here when henchmen 278 gets their chance to beat Deok-Su. We have a straightforward example of human capacity to be be cut throat ruthless at any given opportunities. Just as the last marble of this game shows Deok-Su got out only by luck. The one on top is only hanging there by mere chances and coincidences.



Throughout the games the players play There are a lot of concepts in play so lets focus on a few. We observe players in stressful environment resort to horrendous acts of betrayal and evils to selfishly get ahead. On the flip side, there is also the human compassion for others and bonding in the face of adversity.

Deok-Su and his goon: Betrayal as a given

Cho Sang-woo and Ali Abdul: Betrayal of good faith and friendship

Kang Sae-beyok and Ji-Yeong: Bonds of Friendship

Seong Gi-hun and Oh Il-nam: Betrayal of Friendship yet the Bonds of Friendships.
