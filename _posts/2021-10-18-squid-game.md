Who is not talking about Squid Game right now. I learned about this show a few days ago from a comment during a twitch stream. I recently finished binging the entire series and have some thoughts particularly about one episode. This will be going into spoilers so fair warning. I will set up my initial experience and go in-depth about a particular episode. 

This is one my rare dive into live action side of entertainment. I primarily stick to Japanese anime because I find it aesthetically pleasing. I am fairly experience in mostly Japanese otaku culture and Korean MMORPG. Overall, I have a great lack of Korean specific cultural knowledge but enough Asian media that I was not going to be completely blindsided by Squid Game. Last chance before I dive into the premise and then spoilers of Squid Game.

I essentially did no research and dived straight into episode one. Squid Game at its core is essentially a battle royale death game. Now, I have seen many variations of the the battle royale genre such as Btooom, Liar Game, Mirai Nikki, Gamble Fish and Magical Girl Rising Project to name a few. It is a commonly used plot in manga around late 2000 to early 2010. Even now there are plenty of new iterations around the whole concept of high stakes or death game. Typically, we get a group of people from all walks of life. A mix of environment, equipment, abilities, or rules to equalize the playing field. Usually ending in some human experiment, betting spectacle, or some divine joke. The setting lends itself to examine humanity when pushed to extreme conditions. 

Squid Game follows the formula very well. Children games are used as the great equalizer due to the simple rules and appeals to nostalgia. It gathers a varied casts of players that are knocked down and kept down by society. We have our main cast, Seong Gi-hun a man who wants to be there for the people he cares but spiralling into gambling addiction to find a reversal in life. Cho Sang-woo, the village's prodigy, who landed a successful career but seems to have dipped into white collar crimes to maintain the good son facade. Kang Sae-byeok, a northern defector, involve in the underworld to gather her family for a new start. Oh Il-nam, a discriminated aged ill man, that wants to enjoy his remaining time. Jang Deok-Su, the thug and bully, a gangster who crossed some bigger thugs. Ali Abdul, the discriminated immigrant, working to support his family.  

Alright, everything is setup for a discussion for episode six. The audience has a good understanding of the main cast and Deok-Su plus his henchmen dynamics. Episode six is features some games of marbles and had everyone pair up. Let us take a look at the pairings.

First up we have Deok-Su and his henchmen 278. Deok-Su believes the strongest is the most fit so he rules the group with violence and coercion. He gathered like minded followers who follow the strong but are looking to be the strongest themselves. It was mention in an earlier episode that Deok-Su has a likelihood of being usurp by his own group. We see it manifest here when henchmen 278 gets their chance to beat Deok-Su. We have a straightforward example of human capacity to be be cut throat ruthless at any given opportunities. Just as the last marble of this game shows Deok-Su got out only by luck. The one on top is only hanging there by mere chances and coincidences. Betrayal is a standard it is only a matter of time and chances.

Next we move to Sang-woo and Ali. Ali is in a foreign country and working in dodgy manual labor. Spends six months doing unpaid work because of social pressures. He is used to taking the lower position in a social dynamic. That is why Ali defaults to nim instead of ssi when talking to Sang-woo in episode two. In the same episode, Sang-woo listens and grants Ali's requests. Throughout the games Sang-woo and Gi-hun help supplement Ali's ignorance in Korean language and culture. That is why Ali sees these two people as reliable teammates and begins forming friendly bonds. 

Sang-woo is very interesting character but for brevity I will only touch upon his archetype here. He is the prime example of modern day pragmatist. Sang-woo always weigh the cost and benefits while helping others when it is not detrimental to himself. This behaviour pattern can also be cynically interpreted as putting on a facade of human relationships for your own benefits. He creates the team but never sticks his neck out cautious of the smallest risk. 

Sang-woo's behavior is on the same side of the selfishness scale as Deok-Su but better control to foster longer term useful connections. The logical end in this dynamic is Sang-woo coming out on top by taking advantage of Ali's trust.  Humans are capable of forming bonds. However, bonds can also be betrayed to further 

Sae Ji section: Self sacrificial. Attempt understand others and do good at the expense of oneself's well being.

Gi-hun Il-nam: Betrayal and forgiveness the healing of trust and bonds.

It goes in that specific order in the episode. It starts at one end of the scale the selfish betrayal. It moves to the muddy middle. It goes to the selfless sacrifice. Then finally the last is the lessons from the previous three. People have the capacity to betray and yet there are understandable reasons. Understanding those reasons may provide reasons for forgiveness. The one betrayed can also forgive. The betrayer can regain a part of their trust in humanity.

Throughout the games the players play There are a lot of concepts in play so lets focus on a few. We observe players in stressful environment resort to horrendous acts of betrayal and evils to selfishly get ahead. On the flip side, there is also the human compassion for others and bonding in the face of adversity.

Deok-Su and his goon: Betrayal as a given

Cho Sang-woo and Ali Abdul: Betrayal of good faith and friendship

Kang Sae-beyok and Ji-Yeong: Bonds of Friendship

Seong Gi-hun and Oh Il-nam: Betrayal of Friendship yet the Bonds of Friendships.
