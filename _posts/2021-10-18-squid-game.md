Squid Game who is not talking about Squid Game. Might as well throw my thoughts out there. I just learned about this show a few days ago by an offhand comment during a twitch stream. I recently finished binging the entire series and have some thoughts particularly about one episode. This will be going into full spoilers so fair warning. I will set up my initial experience and go in-depth about a particular episode. 

This is my rare dive into live action side of entertainment. I primarily stick to Japanese anime because I find it aesthetically pleasing. My interests were also more drawn towards Japanese, Chinese, and Korean culture and history. I am fairly experience in mostly Japanese otaku culture and Korean MMORPG. Overall, I have a great lack of Korean specific cultural knowledge but enough Asian media that I was not going to be completely blindsided by Squid Game. Last chance before I dive into the premise and then spoilers of Squid Game.

I essentially did no research and dived straight into episode one. Squid Game at its core is essentially a battle royale death game. Now, I have seen many variations of the the battle royale genre such as Btooom, Liar Game, Mirai Nikki, Gamble Fish and Magical Girl Rising Project to name a few. It is a commonly used plot in manga around late 2000 to early 2010. Even now there are plenty of new iterations around the whole concept of high stakes or death game. Typically, we get a group of people from all walks of life. A mix of environment, equipment, abilities, or rules to equalize the playing field. Usually ending in some big human experiment, betting spectacle, or some divine joke. The setting lends itself to examine humanity when pushed to the extreme conditions. 

Squid Game follows the formula very well. Squid Game uses children games as the great equalizer as the games have simple rules and appeals to nostalgia. It gathers a varied casts of players that are knocked down and kept down by society for various reasons. We have our main cast, Seong Gi-hun a man who wants to be there for the people he cares but spiraling into gambling addiction to find a reversal in life. Cho Sang-woo, the village's prodigy, who landed a successful career but seems to have dipped into white collar crimes to maintain the successful son facade. Kang Sae-byeok, a northern defector, involve in the underworld to gather her family to start in another country. Oh Il-nam, a discriminated aged ill man, that wants to enjoy his remaining time. Ali Abdul, the discriminated immigrant, working to support his family. 

There are a lot of concepts to in play
