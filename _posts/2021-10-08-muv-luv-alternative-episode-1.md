Well interesting way to start this series. We get what seems like an anime original telling of the first BETA invasion of Japan. Does a cliff notes version of establishing the current state of the world. Better adaptation move as much as I love reading info dump lectures from the original it does not translate well to a tv format.

Honestly, I never really dived too deeply into the side content other then half pay attention to the two anime spin-offs. I only recognize some of the navy so anyone else shown here not sure if they are connected to anything else.

Fighting animation and CG is mediocre to decent no surprise given the trailers. I do like design of the Tactical Surface Fighters(TSF). I believe it is the Gekishin variants so them being blocky makes sense and is overall better CGs than Total Eclipse.  BETA is major improvement from Total Eclipse. Schwarzesmarken BETA are okay but everything had a blizzard filter so I never really cared too much. It just feels like it is one step short or a tweak to be really good. The models looks really good. The animation is okay and not everything has to be Guilty Gear Strive levels. Maybe it is the faux-line work, compositing, or high color saturation that does not feel right to me.

I love navel bombardment and Muv-Luv usually delivers so hurray. Also a fan of music that fits the mood rather than what is on screen. It is probably just the ending theme but it sets a good precedent for the sound direction.

The plot is simple at expense for world building so good choice. Love them setting up the themes and motifs with the citizens refusing the evacuation. Giving newer viewers similar context to an evacuation incident that occurs in the earlier game. The motif that fell flat was the soldier martyr as characters barely got any development. Understandable for being a one off episode who knows maybe we will get more anime original to supplement some areas. The main crew of alternative is set to appear next episode and the main story will start.
