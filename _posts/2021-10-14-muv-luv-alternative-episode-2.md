Just getting this out of the way first, not Asu e Houkou. If Jam Project is too expensive then at least keep the dramatic violin. One can dream anyways, generic opening is generic not much to say other than it is a missed opportunity to stand out.

We spend nearly most of the episode just setting the world while going through condensed highlights of previous games events. Even if it was a 100% adaptation the sequences of events are the same. The beginning of Alternative is also a short summary as there was a three year gap between the games release.

It only feels very fast paced to a reader as we actively try to recall content that is being “skipped”. Whereas the newcomers are just being flooded with tons of plot points that they just have to take in stride. This is where the “show don’t tell” mantra rears itself as readers are already shown the events but the newcomers are being told it. Obviously, newcomers have no emotional stake yet so at best it just feels like an interesting line of events. At worst, it sounds like a convoluted mess.

This is why it is often recommended to read Extra and Unlimited. Start of Alternative forgoes the initial character development in favor of blitzing through the plot as it is a summary with some tweaks for later setup. It is intended for the audience to be somewhat invested in some characters at this point.

The viewer has not been confronted with an event to get emotionally attached to a character until the very end of the episode with Meiya. Now for the best part of the episode. Yuuko poses the question why should Takeru and by extension the audience care about this world. Takeru meets up with Meiya to continue the train of thought. This is my favorite part of how Muv Luv's impressive world building can generate interesting social politics dynamics. The still montage playing during Meiya’s monologue shows a very good self-contained story and is directly related to Meiya’s motivations. 

It shows a normal civilian family and the conflict of humanity’s wider draft requirements for survival. It is a nice grey area. Humanity is dying so all hands are needed on deck. On the opposite ends, it can be used as justification to trample on the will of civilians and delegate their needs as secondary. So my question is who is in the right? The military guys getting more able bodies to fight humanity’s enemy? The family that wants the child to choose their own fate? The answer is to ponder the question and not necessarily answer. All this gives us a glimpse into Meiya’s world perspective as it encompsses both of these sides during the monologue. This scene was a really good scene to flesh out a character.

Now the new characters’ designs fit the theme and tone but are bland. Everyone looks fine however I still prefer the old design as they are more charming and memorable. It is a crime to take away Tama's <a class="tooltipImage" href="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/nottama.jpg">cat ear hair style<span><img class="tooltip" src="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/nottama.jpg"></span></a>. They have committed <a class="tooltipImage" href="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/ogtama.jpg">treachery<span><img class="tooltip" src="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/ogtama.jpg"></span></a> against our <a class="tooltipImage" href="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/leader.jpg">fearless squad leader<span><img class="tooltip" src="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/leader.jpg"></span></a>. Jokes aside, Marimo is the only one that really throws me off.

Everyone sounds good and is accurately represented. I clapped when Norio Wakamoto reprises his role as base commander, no name yet so I will refrain too. The new cast is a really good fit as they manage to faithfully portray the characters. I am rewatching some play throughs and there is a difference in sound. However, the character acting and vocal delivery is spot on. The only one that stands out to me is Meiya. Okujima Kazumi’s Meiya feels perfect because of how it matches Meiya’s exaggerated traditional formal character. Now Karin Nanami does a very good job as Meiya so even though it is not the same it is nothing to worry about. <a class="tooltipImage" href="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/notmeiya.jpg">Nana Mizuki would also be perfect as it would continue the suffering blue swordswoman role<span><img class="tooltip" src="/assets/img/uploads/MuvLuvA02/notmeiya.jpg"></span></a> though that would probably be way out of budget for this show.

Wow animation in general is quite something as the studio must really be on a tight budget. It has a few rough spots. Mostly perspective and odd directing choices are the biggest offenders.

Overall, a mediocre necessary episode with a nice final scene. I do not really like the ending theme too much. Only positive thing is the bunny girl.
