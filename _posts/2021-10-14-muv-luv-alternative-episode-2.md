* Obligatory Op not Asu e Houkou. Cadet Armor are are not transparent yay. Actually would be more impressive if they were transparent
* That is a game guy advance not a game guy wth.
* Very brisk pace. In acceptable as for like a quick highlights/cliff notes version for anime only. Novel reader wise feels character moments does not really sink in. Couple of clips of what cadet life to get a feel for it but never as in-depth as in novels. This scenes felt rush to me but that is mainly why I prefer reading as I can control the pace and think about the events. Probably why I read more light/wed novels now a days than watch anime.  Immersion vs tv pacing is always tricky to handle 
* Now I have been re-watching playthroughs for about a month now of the Muv Luv Trilogy so I am mostly familiar of this dialog between Yuuko and Takeru. The anime is mixing pieces of Unlimited and Alternative which makes the conversation a lot smoother. Cuts out the small bits like the back and forth with the access pass so the anime can focus on the main points. Now for the anime original with flashback galore. Obviously we need those to tackle two big points the whole parallel world/time weirdness shenanigans and the Alternative V. Understandable these are for newcomers and a refreshers for others. Whelp waiting for the whole Isekai thing to be thrown around. Conspiracy about anime original content diverging plot threads blah
* Norio Wakamoto I clap. Reprises his role as base commander. Voices... I knew going in the main cast was going to be recasted and art redesign. Now Karin Nanami does a pretty good job as Meiya so there is nothing worry about. Still sad about Meiya's voice goes back to listening VN voice lines. I love the princess knight archetype listening to Okujima Kazumi was very good and distinct match to Meiya's particular style of speech. I am no expert but most of the new vocal cast pretty much sound similar to the original cast. Someone else can nitpick about the sound difference the character acting so far is faithfully and matches the original. Tama can do no wrong for she is our fearless squad leader.
* The actual art redesigns. No more airvents or spikey hair which takes away the distinctness of the original design. Probably easier to animate too. It is a crime though to take away Tama's cat ear. Overall they are kind of bland but functional so but the sacrifices for animations anime going to get too hung up on it. Hoping future VNs at least maintains high quality design.
* A couple shots seem odd mainly due to perspective. Yuuko sitting broad shoulders, beginning of march. Can only hope for blu-ray touch ups as hopefully they are just budgeting for later episodes.
* Hmm ED is meh. I want to talk about tone of OP and ED has an odd whiplash from the first episode's tone. I think there are big brain plays here I want to say more but won't elaborate. If there are any new fans hope you have fun at least and maybe give the visual novel a shot.
